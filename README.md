With this project we used timeseries forecasting to optimize pricing for restaurant tables and tennis court bookings.

Our main finding was that people, before introducing dynamic pricing, would book primarily after work on weekdays, and all day during weekends.

We see the average booking times across all ways of the week:

If we change the price, we see how the demand changes, increasing revenue from our fixed capacity of our restaurant tables/tennis courts:

Even when faced with missing data for a time period, the model easily fills in the blanks:
